### Hi there 👋

- 🧑‍💻 I mostly enjoy coding in C#, Haskell and Rust, but I've used about a dozen of other languages over the last few years
- 📃 When I find enough time, I try to contribute to [Typst](https://github.com/typst/typst)
- 🔭 I did some work on a rust implementation of a game dialog system for the `Yarn` language, [Yarn Slinger](https://github.com/yarn-slinger/yarn-slinger)
- 😀 I'm a functional programming enthusiast
- 🎨 I'm a huge fan of [Funcky](https://github.com/polyadic/funcky) (and [Funcky.DiscriminatedUnion](https://github.com/polyadic/funcky-discriminated-union))
- ☝️ I used to be somewhat active on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/5962841/mafii)
- 👨‍🔬 One of my favorite projects is/was a [Lambda Calculus Quasi Quoter](https://github.com/Mafii/mafi-lambda-calculus) for Haskell
- 🧑‍🎓 I'm currently doing my bachelor's degree in part time at [OST](https://www.ost.ch/)
- 🏢 My day-to-day work is mostly about web servers, build infrastructure and software deployment and installation
